## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - Vue.js state management library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

The next step of the project would possibly be fetching data from an API or including a database into its functionality. Considering it's a small project, state management with Vuex seemed like a reasonable solution.
